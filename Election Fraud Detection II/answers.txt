Answer to Problem 7:

The output from the program is below:
	2009 Iranian election MSE: 0.000739583333333
	Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 393
	Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 9607
	2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.0393
The data suggests the Iranian election results are fraudulent. The Iranian dataset is
highly unlikely to be genuine. We are 96.07% confident that the data is fraudulent. More
precisely, we say we reject the null hypothesis at the p = .0393 level. This means that only about 3.93% of genuine elections would be as different from the uniform distribution as the Iranian election was. The result has passed the p=0.05 threshold and thus meaning the result is statistical significant.

Answer to Problem 8:

The output from the program is below:
	2008 United States election MSE: 0.000141002587606
	Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2008 United States election MSE: 4885
	Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2008 United States election MSE: 5115
	2008 United States election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.4885
The data suggests that 51.15% of genuine election were as different from the uniform distribution as the United States election was. This is not surprising at all; it provides no evidence regarding the null hypothesis that the United States election is not fraudulent. The p-value has not passed the threshold of p=0.05 and the result is not
statistically significant.
